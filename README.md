# IntroDH

This is my project for the course Introduction to Digital Humanities. 
I study Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig, first semester.
To use the project, simply download the .zip file and execute the "Main.R" in R-Studio. Please, be careful when removing any files, since the project might then not work properly. It is recommended to not change anything at all in the directory.
After downloading the .zip file, extract it to make sure it runs well.
